## 📌 Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive benchmark suite of machine learning algorithms applied to Parkinson’s disease (PD) diagnosis across five major modalities. The aim is to support **transparency**, **reproducibility**, and **future development** in computer-aided PD diagnosis research.

---

## 🧪 Modalities Covered

The following data modalities are included in our benchmark case studies:

- MRI
- Voice
- Gait
- EEG
- Handwriting

---

## Reproducing Results

All benchmark results reported in the paper can be reproduced using the provided scripts and configurations.
